  title: "Precise End-Effector Control for an Aerial Manipulator Under Composite Disturbances: Theory and Experiments"
  venue: IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE TASE), 2024
  description: "In this work, a composite control scheme is constructed, which consists of the manipulator joint velocity planner 
  and the dynamic controller. The idea is intuitive. The joint velocity is generated to counteract the fluctuation of the aerial platform. 
  Furthermore, the dynamic controller is developed to accurately track the planned joint velocity in the presence of strong coupling and model 
  uncertainties. The proposed scheme guarantees the stability of the close loop system, making our approach especially promising solution for aerial 
  manipulation under composite disturbances."
