# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering and Shenyuan Honors College, Beihang University, China.
  I am supervised by Prof. [Lei Guo](https://ai.google/research/), Prof. [Xiang Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6UgtuZ8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), and Prof. [Kexin Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=c0MaejIAAAAJ). 
  Robots deployed in the real world inevitably face uncertainties caused by internal model mismatch and external unmeasured disturbances. 
  The topic of my Ph.D. research is intelligent control and dexterous operation of aerial manipulator.
